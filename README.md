How To Use:
  Enter the path to the folder you want organized
  Each type of files would be stored in its own sub_directory in the chosen directory
  Make sure you have the rights to read, write and remove files and folders in the parent folder of your targeted folder
  Warning: a copy of the orginal folder would be named "Backup_temp"and placd in the same parent folder while the original folder would get organized and the files with the same names would have a random number added to the end of their names(without affecting the extension except in the category other). The list of supported file types is specified in the package's website 'https://pypi.org/project/filetype/'
